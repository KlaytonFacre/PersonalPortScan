# PersonalPortScan
This is a personal project for educational purpose only!
This is subject to updates as I learn new ways to code this app.

# Usage
pscan target [lower_port] [upper_port]

[lower_limit]: Optional to set the start port of the scan range.

[upper_limit]: Optional to set the end port of the scan range.

pscan will automatically scan the first 1024 ports if not tell otherwise.
